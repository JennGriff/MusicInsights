First we need to install tidyverse

```{r}

#There are 3 interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:
#
## 1. Each variable must have its own column.
#
##2. Each observation must have its own row.
#
##3. Each value must have its own cell.

#####practical instructions:
#
# 1. Put each dataset in a tibble.
#
# 2. Put each variable in a column.

#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

## Read directly from source adds authenticity and consistency 

## Avoid absolute paths : the whole path from root

## Use relative paths : relative to this project. Can use urls

## ?read_csv

survey <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/music-survey.csv")

preferences <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/preferences-survey.csv")
```

```{r}
## Inspect Data

View(preferences)
nrow(preferences)
ncol(preferences)
levels(preferences$`What was your pseudonym?`)
#summary(preferences)

## Interpreting NA with na option
```

Cleaning data frame column names:
```{r}
##Changing the name of a column

colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "What is your pseudonym?" ] <- "pseudonym"

colnames(survey)[colnames(survey)== "First, we are going to create a pseudonym for you to keep this survey anonymous (more or less). Which pseudonym generator would you prefer?"] <- "generator_name"


```


Notes::
```{r}
#split string by a character (, " ")
?strsplit

#Parse functions
?parse_datetime

```

```{r}

```
